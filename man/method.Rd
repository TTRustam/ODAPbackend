\arguments{
\item{location}{Optional. Country or region name/ISO code. Used if inputs are
to be automatically downloaded from WPP.}

\item{refDate}{Numeric or \code{Date}. Reference date of the population count (e.g.,
census year and month, converted internally to decimal date).}

\item{Age}{Integer vector. Lower bounds of single-year ages (if \code{NULL}, inferred
from input names or length of \code{Females_single}).}

\item{Females_single}{Numeric vector. Female population counts by single year
of age at \code{refDate}.}

\item{Males_single}{Optional numeric vector. Male population counts by single year
of age at \code{refDate}.}

\item{nLxFemale, nLxMale}{Life table person-years lived by age and sex. Can be
provided directly or downloaded if \code{location} is supplied.}

\item{nLxDatesIn}{Numeric vector of input dates corresponding to \code{nLxFemale}
and \code{nLxMale}. Defaults to \code{refDate - c(0.5, 9.5)}.}

\item{AsfrMat}{Matrix or data.frame of age-specific fertility rates (ASFR),
with ages 15–49 in rows and dates in columns.}

\item{AsfrDatesIn}{Numeric vector of input dates for \code{AsfrMat}. Defaults to
\code{refDate - c(0.5, 9.5)}.}

\item{SRB}{Optional numeric vector of sex ratios at birth (males per female).
If \code{NULL}, values are downloaded when \code{location} is provided.}

\item{SRBDatesIn}{Numeric vector of input dates for \code{SRB}. Defaults to the
three anchor dates \code{refDate - c(0.5, 2.5, 7.5)}.}

\item{radix}{Life table radix (default = 1). If \code{NULL}, inferred from \code{nLx}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical (default = \code{TRUE}). Print assumptions and progress.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to [interp()].}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{Females_adjusted}{Numeric vector of reconstructed female counts (ages 0–9 adjusted).}
\item{Males_adjusted}{Numeric vector of reconstructed male counts (ages 0–9 adjusted).}
\item{Females_single}{Original female counts (input).}
\item{Males_single}{Original male counts (input).}
\item{nLxf}{Interpolated female life table values.}
\item{nLxm}{Interpolated male life table values.}
\item{Asfr}{Interpolated ASFR by age and date.}
\item{Exposure_female}{Estimated female exposures aged 15–49 at anchor dates.}
\item{Bt}{Estimated total births at each anchor date.}
\item{SRB}{Sex ratio at birth used in the reconstruction.}
\item{Age}{Age vector used.}
}
}
\description{
Estimates the base population by age and sex using the cohort-component
reverse survival method with \strong{single-year ages}. The function reconstructs
births from observed female populations of reproductive age, age-specific
fertility rates (ASFR), survival ratios, and the sex ratio at birth (SRB).
Births are then distributed by sex and survived to ages 0–9, replacing
reported counts in those ages.
}
\details{
This function is analogous to [basepop_five()], but works with **single-year**
age groups instead of 5-year age groups. Female exposures aged 15–49 are
reverse-survived one year to estimate births across three anchor dates
(`refDate - c(0.5, 2.5, 7.5)`). Births are then split by sex using the SRB
and survived to obtain reconstructed populations for ages 0–9. Older ages
remain unchanged.
